### Philosophy & Values

**Q: Do you consent to your data being stored and reviewed for this residency?**
A: As you wish.

**Q: If someone hurt your feelings, did they do something wrong?**
A: Not inherently. If I have hurt feelings they are mine to process and I will discern whether to invite the other party to consider my experience.

**Q: What's a recent belief you changed?**
A: I'm chuckling to myself because it's not beliefs that have changed but how to integrate them. For instance I believe when I am confronted or offended by something or someone there will be a misalignment of values or a misunderstanding. In that case I can make an enquiry and register/consider my values. How I respond determines whether I am integrated and able to act with agency and respect. If I defer and compromise I forfeit harmony and my value.

**Q: If we really knew you, what would we know?**
A: If you knew me you would know that I wish to play. That my depth of inquiry is to make a safe place for the nourishing wisdom of play.

A: Confidence. Confiding in myself. Allowing my own goodness and intentionality and inspiration to be the governing principle for my life.

**Q: What's your ideal way of getting to know a new person?**
A: It's all in what we do and say and how we move. The body tells the truth. How we cook and clean and dance. Many people open at different rates on different terms. So getting to know someone is generally on their terms :P

**Q: What questions, if any, do you like to ask strangers?**
A: Have you experienced an inconvenient delight recently or been surprised by happenstance. 

What is your most cherished restorative activity.

Did you see the sun rise this morning!?

**Q: In your own words, how do you identify?**
A: Passport or drivers licence usually. Haha. But ah I'm guessing you mean in terms of gender identity. So I'm a man.

**Q: Are there any topics which are not OK to discuss?**
A: I don't know them if there are any.

**Q: What's your favorite conspiracy theory?**
A: I quite like this fellow bassforge and this other gent er charlie solis.

The theories and research they cover are largely regarding resonance. seismic schuman ELF waves oscillating our earth and minds with architecture built as capacitors and other tremendous things.

**Q: What do you believe is true that most other people believe is false?**
A: Astrology. Under the pretense that a marvellous constellar choreography is whipping up our curious experience by mechanical resonance. 

Aaand I believe in exceptions to rules.

**Q: What, if anything, does astrology mean to you?**
A: Oh I just mentioned this. 
It is a comprehensive lens to consider the aspects of self or god in procession. It helps articulate the gnosis of cyclical nature and relationality.

**Q: If some robots are doctors and some doctors are purple, does it logically follow that some robots must be purple?**
A: No not logical but it's not excluding the possibility either.

**Q: What's your take on the whole Israel/Palestine thing? 50 words of less.**
