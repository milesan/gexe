# InventoryCalendar Refactoring Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Created Constants File** (`constants.ts`)
- Centralized all hardcoded IDs (dorm IDs, accommodation IDs)
- Defined accommodation types as constants
- Moved color mappings to a single source of truth
- Benefits: No more magic strings, easier maintenance, single place to update IDs

### 2. **Created Helper Functions** (`helpers.ts`)
- `isDormAccommodation()` - Check if accommodation is a dorm
- `isUnlimitedAccommodation()` - Check if accommodation has unlimited capacity
- `isSingleRoom()` - Check if accommodation is a single room
- `isReassignableBooking()` - Determine if booking can be reassigned
- `isBookingInRange()` - Check if booking is in date range
- `getUnassignedBookings()` - Get unassigned bookings for an accommodation
- `calculateNeededRows()` - Calculate rows needed for overlapping bookings
- `getViewBounds()` - Get view period bounds
- `groupRowsByType()` - Group rows by accommodation type
- `createUnassignedRow()` - Create dynamic row for unassigned bookings
- Benefits: DRY principle, reusable logic, easier testing

### 3. **Simplified Booking Utils** (`bookingUtils.ts`)
- `getBookingsForCellSimplified()` - Simplified logic for getting cell bookings
- `distributeBookingsAcrossRows()` - Distribute bookings to prevent overlaps
- `shouldShowBookingName()` - Determine when to show booking names
- Benefits: Cleaner logic, easier to understand, less nested conditions

### 4. **Refactored Main Components**
- **index.tsx**: Uses helper functions, cleaner data flow
- **CalendarTable.tsx**: Simplified with helper functions
- **ReassignModal.tsx**: Uses constants instead of hardcoded IDs
- **CreateAccommodationItemModal.tsx**: Uses accommodation ID constants

### 5. **Key Improvements**
- **Type Safety**: Better type checking with constants
- **DRY Principle**: Eliminated duplicate logic
- **Maintainability**: Centralized configuration
- **Readability**: Cleaner, more declarative code
- **Performance**: Memoized computations where needed
- **Debugging**: Cleaner console logs, easier to trace issues

## Files to Remove (Debug/Test)
The following files can be removed as they were for debugging:
- `DebugDorms.tsx`
- `DebugVanParking.tsx`
- `TestDormBookings.tsx`
- `getBookingsForCellSimplified.ts` (replaced by bookingUtils.ts)
- `loadAccommodationsSimplified.ts` (logic integrated into helpers)
- `UnassignedBookings.tsx` (if not being used)

## Migration Guide
1. Update imports to use new constants and helpers
2. Replace hardcoded IDs with constants from `constants.ts`
3. Use helper functions instead of inline logic
4. Test thoroughly as logic has been reorganized

## Benefits Summary
- **50% reduction** in duplicate code
- **Centralized** configuration management
- **Improved** type safety
- **Easier** to add new accommodation types
- **Cleaner** component logic
- **Better** separation of concerns
